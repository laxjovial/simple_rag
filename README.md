Perfect â€” you're building a **semantic document explorer** with **zero LLM**, powered by **embeddings + similarity + clustering + search + Streamlit UI**. Letâ€™s break it down and build everything:

## ðŸ”§ TECHNOLOGY STACK

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll use:

| Tool                         | Purpose                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**                   | General scripting                                  |
| **ChromaDB**                 | Vector database for storing + searching embeddings |
| **SentenceTransformers**     | To embed paragraphs/sentences                      |
| **Scikit-learn (KMeans)**    | To cluster similar content                         |
| **Streamlit**                | For interactive web app                            |
| **Pandas**                   | Data handling                                      |
| *(Optional)* **UMAP/Plotly** | 2D cluster visualization                           |

## âœ… OVERVIEW OF THE PIPELINE

1. Load document (PDF or plain text)
2. Chunk into paragraphs/sentences
3. Embed each chunk
4. Cluster embeddings
5. Store in ChromaDB with metadata (`text`, `cluster_id`, etc.)
6. Build Streamlit interface:

   * Explore clusters by topic
   * Search semantically
   * Filter by clusters

## âœ… WHAT YOU NOW HAVE:

* ðŸ”¹ Fully **local pipeline**
* ðŸ”¹ Clustering without needing LLMs
* ðŸ”¹ Semantic search based on sentence-level relevance
* ðŸ”¹ Interactive **Streamlit app**

## ðŸ§  OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:

| Feature                                 | How                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Topic labeling for clusters**         | Use keywords from chunks in cluster (TF-IDF) |
| **UMAP plot of clusters**               | `umap-learn` + `plotly`                      |
| **Search within selected cluster only** | Use `.query(..., where={"cluster": x})`      |
| **Auth / Upload new docs in Streamlit** | Add upload + process pipeline                |
| **Batch processing**                    | Run over many docs, tag by `doc_id`          |

---

âœ… Features Included
Upload multiple PDFs

Auto-split into paragraphs/sentences

Embed chunks for vector similarity search using ChromaDB

Tag documents with titles/topics

View by document or doc_id

Visualize document clusters with UMAP + Plotly

Filter/search within clusters or documents

Show similar text chunks for context refinement

## ðŸš€ FINAL THOUGHT

Youâ€™re now equipped with a **modular, local, LLM-free semantic retrieval system**, using embedding + clustering + vector search â€” great for research, enterprise docs, technical support, etc.

Would you like:

* A downloadable ZIP of the whole app?
* Or to add support for multiple documents / filtering by titles?

Let me know how you want to expand it.
